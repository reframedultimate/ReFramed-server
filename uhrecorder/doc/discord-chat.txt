[10:16 PM] jam1garner: anyways I'd say:
1. start by learning how to make a skyline plugin
2. learn how to hook status scripts (I don't remember how to do that but someone here does, probably ask around in #code-editsssüêç probably)
3. make a simple plugin where you just hook some common status scripts like jump, double jump, roll, whatever you're interested in. when the hook gets hit just print out the current status
4. learn the basics of Rust's networking (I swear it's simpler than in C, shouldn't be hard to pick up)
5. when your plugin's main is run (i.e. when the game is booting) spawn a new a thread and within that thread start up a TcpListener
6. Learn serde (https://serde.rs/), this will make your life extremely easy for actually sending all your information through the TcpListener
7. have a program running on your pc that connects to your switch to pull off your data from the TcpListener, then do whatever you want with the data

note: alternatively, if you'd prefer, you could just log what you're interested in to a file

[10:18 PM] TheComet: This is great information thanks a bunch
[10:18 PM] jam1garner: note that that last link, while similar to what you want, uses some outdated stuff
[10:19 PM] jam1garner: for example, since then we've implemented Rust's std::net tcp stuff
[10:19 PM] jam1garner: while that link uses bsd sockets
[10:21 PM] jam1garner: here's an example that uses smush_info in order to graph the percentage in real time https://github.com/jam1garner/graph_percent
